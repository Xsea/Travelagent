Imagine a future of star faring humanity. We are now living in the whole solar system and beyond, having colonies on
many planets and moons. In this future, we found the first human habitable planet outside of earth. Its name is
MASSAGE-2(A-B)b and it is located in the binary star system of Akycha. The planet offers a completely different ecology
with plants and creatures reminding of things you can find on earth, but still completely different. Also the nature
and its landmarks are similar but slightly different. Additionally, the planet offers remains of an old alien
civilization, which seems to have died out. In between the nature, old artifacts, buildings and other remains can be
found. The planet is stil being actively researched and not all dangers (natural or from the old remains)
have been discovered or contained.


Using this outline, please write a tourist brochure, describing the wonders and reasons to visit MASSAGE-2(A-B)b for
your vacation. Invent Cities, architectural sights, landmarks and nature, things special to this alien planet, where
the vacation is probably geared to the more adventurous people, but also offers some secured cities and
areas for a relaxing stay
